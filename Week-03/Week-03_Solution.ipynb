    "\n",
    "6. **When the initial prompt \"Create a dataset\" is too broad, what should you do to refine it?**  \n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è You should add context, details, and constraints (e.g., type of dataset, size, format, domain) to make the request more specific and actionable."

    "- AI can maintain a resource tracker (like who booked a meeting room or borrowed equipment) and alert when conflicts arise.\n",

    "# **Questions from \"3 Use AI as a creative or expert partner\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Questions for Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?  \n",
    "Because both involve breaking a big, complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces and then combining them to form the complete picture. Each ‚Äúprompt‚Äù is like a puzzle piece that contributes to the final solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What‚Äôs the main difference between iteration and chaining?  \n",
    "- Iteration = refining the same prompt multiple times to improve the output.\n",
    "- Chaining = breaking a complex task into a sequence of smaller prompts, where each output feeds into the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why might prompt chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?  \n",
    "Because one big question can overwhelm the model, leading to vague or unfocused results. Chaining keeps the task structured, guides the model step by step, and ensures higher accuracy and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can the context window of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?  \n",
    "The context window limits how much information the model can ‚Äúremember‚Äù at once. If your chain is too long, earlier details may get lost. To manage this, you might need to:\n",
    "    - Summarize intermediate outputs.\n",
    "    - Use external storage (notes, databases) to carry context forward.\n",
    "    - Keep each step concise.\n",

    "3. Suggests solutions for the most critical issue.\n",
    "\n",

    "- From the summary above, identify urgent tasks that require immediate attention. List them with deadlines and responsible people.\n",

    "- **Better trade-offs:** Combining them lets you generate many options (ToT) and then rigorously justify and refine one (CoT), improving quality of final plans.  \n",
    "- **Faster iteration:** Clear, numbered steps and evaluation metrics make it easy to tweak assumptions and re-run specific parts of the chain.  \n",

    "How could prompt chaining help you **simplify a complex project** or **improve collaboration** in your workplace?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt chaining could simplify a complex project by breaking it into smaller, manageable steps‚Äîlike first outlining goals, then expanding tasks, and finally creating visuals or activities. This structured flow prevents overwhelm and ensures clarity at each stage. For collaboration, chaining helps align the team: each prompt can focus on a different aspect (e.g., one for project scope, another for task assignments, another for timelines), so everyone works with consistent, AI-generated guidance. This keeps communication clear, reduces misalignment, and speeds up decision-making.\n",

    "# **Report ‚Äì Joni Eats Chatbot**\n",
    "This section answers the guideline‚Äôs questions (1‚Äì6) in narrative form for reporting and submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Use Case, Target Users, Benefits, Limitations\n",
    "Use case: A customer-facing cafe assistant for Joni Eats. The bot answers menu questions, dietary info (vegan/halal/gluten‚Äëfree), opening hours, location, specials, wait times, and simple ordering guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Target users: Walk‚Äëin customers, regulars, and first‚Äëtime visitors who want quick answers without waiting for staff during rush hours.\n",
    "- Expected benefits: Faster service, fewer repetitive questions for staff, consistent information, and better discovery of items (e.g., seasonal specials).\n",
    "- Limitations: Not a payment system, no real‚Äëtime inventory unless integrated, may not reflect last‚Äësecond menu changes, and should not give medical or legal advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Justification\n",
    "A chatbot is well‚Äësuited because cafe inquiries are short, frequent, and repetitive. Compared to browsing a website/menu PDF, chat supports quick follow‚Äëups (e.g., ‚Äúany nut‚Äëfree desserts?‚Äù) and clarifications. Versus human staff, the bot can answer 24/7 and reduce queue pressure while keeping tone consistent. It will perform retrieval‚Äëaugmented Q&A from a curated knowledge base (menu, policies, specials) and follow a conversation flow for greetings, clarifying questions, and goodbyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Groq Model Selection\n",
    "Primary model: llama-3.1-8b-instant on Groq for fast, low‚Äëlatency chat. Rationale:\n",
    "- Size/speed: 8B is cost‚Äëeffective and responsive for real‚Äëtime interactions; upgrade path to 70B exists for tougher reasoning.\n",
    "- Language: Good English fluency; multilingual support acceptable for basic hospitality queries.\n",
    "- Latency: Groq‚Äôs inference speed improves user experience during live chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Conversation Flow (with samples)\n",
    "Flow:\n",
    "1. Greeting ‚Üí ‚ÄúHi, welcome to Joni Eats! How can I help?‚Äù\n",
    "2. Understand intent ‚Üí Identify if the user asks about menu, hours, location, dietary needs, or specials.\n",
    "3. Retrieve context ‚Üí Pull top KB snippets relevant to the query.\n",
    "4. Respond ‚Üí Provide concise, friendly answer; list 3‚Äì5 options if appropriate.\n",
    "5. Clarify ‚Üí Offer follow‚Äëups: ‚ÄúWant vegan or gluten‚Äëfree options?‚Äù\n",
    "6. Goodbye ‚Üí Close politely or handoff to staff if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample inputs/responses:  \n",
    "- Q: ‚ÄúDo you have vegan lunch options under $12?‚Äù  \n",
    "  A: ‚ÄúYes‚Äîtry our Vegan Power Bowl and Roasted Veggie Wrap (both under $12). Would you like a protein add‚Äëon?‚Äù  \n",
    "- Q: ‚ÄúWhat time do you open on Saturdays?‚Äù  \n",
    "  A: ‚ÄúWe open at 12:00 PM and close at 2:00 AM.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Prompting Technique\n",
    "Technique: Few‚Äëshot prompting (examples from the corpus‚Äôs CHAT_PATTERNS section) plus zero‚Äëshot fallback. The system prompt defines the Joni Eats persona and scope. Structured, bulleted outputs keep answers skimmable. The prompt asks the model to only answer cafe‚Äërelated questions and to gracefully decline out‚Äëof‚Äëscope queries while steering back to menu/hours/specials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Frontend\n",
    "A Streamlit UI makes the bot easy to try: chat interface, settings (model, temperature, top‚Äëk), and an expander that shows retrieved snippets for transparency. This supports quick feedback from staff and customers before deeper integrations (ordering, inventory)."
