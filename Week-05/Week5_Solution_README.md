## 🔑 Required API Keys

Make sure your `.env` file in the root directory contains:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
```

### Getting API Keys:

1. **Groq**: Visit https://console.groq.com/
   - Sign up for free account
   - Generate API key
   - Free tier available

2. **Pinecone**: Visit https://www.pinecone.io/
   - Create free account
   - Get API key
   - Free tier: 1 index, 1GB storage

## 🚀 Running the Notebook

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (.venv) in project root
- API keys configured in .env file
- Internet connection

### Steps:
1. Open `Week5_Solution.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter
2. Ensure kernel is using the .venv Python environment
3. Run cells sequentially from top to bottom
4. Wait for package installation (first cell may take 2-3 minutes)
5. Verify API keys load successfully
6. Follow along with the explanations

### Troubleshooting:
- **Kernel not found**: Select Python interpreter from .venv
- **API key errors**: Check .env file location and format
- **Import errors**: Re-run pip install cell
- **Pinecone errors**: Verify API key and internet connection

## 💡 Key Learnings

### RAG Architecture:
```
Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Retrieve Docs → Augment Prompt → LLM → Response
```

### Why RAG Works:
1. **Semantic Understanding**: Embeddings capture meaning
2. **Efficient Retrieval**: Vector similarity is fast
3. **Dynamic Knowledge**: Update docs without retraining
4. **Cost Effective**: No GPU training needed

### Best Practices:
- Use appropriate chunk sizes (100-500 words)
- Choose good embedding models
- Tune retrieval parameters (k=3-5)
- Implement caching for common queries
- Monitor vector database usage

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Speed:
- Embedding: ~0.1s per chunk
- Retrieval: ~0.2s for 3 documents
- LLM inference: ~1-2s (Groq is fast!)
- Total: ~2-3s per query

### Accuracy:
- Highly dependent on knowledge base quality
- RAG significantly reduces hallucinations
- Source knowledge beats parametric knowledge

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Add conversation memory** with LangChain
2. **Implement source citations** with references
3. **Add re-ranking** for better retrieval
4. **Use hybrid search** (dense + sparse)
5. **Build web interface** with Streamlit
6. **Add evaluation metrics** (RAGAS)
7. **Implement caching** with Redis
8. **Add multi-modal** support (images, PDFs)
