    "## 1. What is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG** is an advanced technique that combines:\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base\n",
    "- **Augmentation**: Adding that information to the prompt\n",
    "- **Generation**: Using an LLM to generate accurate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → Retrieve Relevant Docs → Augment Prompt → LLM Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits:\n",
    "- ✅ Provides up-to-date information\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces hallucinations\n",
    "- ✅ Uses external knowledge without retraining\n",
    "- ✅ Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning"

    "| Aspect | RAG | Fine-tuning |\n",
    "|--------|-----|-------------|\n",
    "| **Cost** | Low (no model training) | High (requires GPU resources) |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Fast (just query vector DB) | Slow (training takes hours/days) |\n",
    "| **Updates** | Easy (just update documents) | Hard (retrain entire model) |\n",
    "| **Data Privacy** | Documents stay separate | Data baked into model |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Dynamic, changing data | Specialized tasks/style |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use RAG:\n",
    "- 📰 News articles and current events\n",
    "- 📖 Documentation and knowledge bases\n",
    "- 🛒 Product catalogs\n",
    "- 📊 Reports and research papers\n",
    "- 💬 Customer support with FAQs\n",

      "\n",
      "In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each example is associated with a target output or label. The goal is to learn a mapping between input data and the corresponding output labels. The algorithm is \"supervised\" because it's given the correct answers to learn from.\n",

      "* Input: Images of dogs and cats\n",
      "* Target output: Label (dog or cat)\n",
      "* Algorithm learns to recognize patterns in the images to predict the correct label\n",

      "Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Input: A dataset of customer purchase history\n",

      "\n",
      "**Supervised Learning:**\n",
      "Supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on training a model to identify and respond to patterns in labelled datasets. The goal is to learn a mapping between input data and their corresponding output labels. This approach is at the heart of many real-world applications of AI, including automated image recognition, disease diagnosis, financial trading strategies, and job recommendation systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
      "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, aims to uncover patterns in unlabelled data and perform tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not rely on labelled data and instead focuses on discovering hidden structures or relationships within the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Labelled vs Unlabelled Data:** Supervised learning uses labelled data, while unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data.\n",
      "2. **Goal:** Supervised learning aims to learn a mapping between input data and their corresponding output labels, whereas unsupervised learning seeks to uncover patterns or relationships within the data.\n",
      "3. **Approach:** Supervised learning typically involves a more structured approach, where the model is trained to predict a specific output based on the input data. Unsupervised learning, by contrast, often involves more exploratory techniques, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.\n",
      "\n",

      "[Question 1] What is the attention mechanism in transformers?\n",
      "The attention mechanism in transformers is a key component that enables the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the output. In the context of the Transformer architecture, the attention mechanism is used in both the encoder and decoder components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Multi-Head Attention Mechanism**\n",
      "\n",
      "The attention mechanism in transformers is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which is a scaled dot-product attention that performs attention ℎ times. This mechanism takes in three inputs: queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). The multi-head attention module performs attention using these inputs, and the outputs of multiple heads are concatenated before being further processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Self-Attention Mechanism**\n",
      "\n",
      "The self-attention mechanism in transformers is a type of attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence. In the decoder, the self-attention mechanism is used after each self-attention layer, and it attends to the output of the encoder. The self-attention mechanism in the decoder also uses a form of autoregressive or causal self-attention, which only allows the model to attend to past outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relative Position Embeddings**\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide an explicit position signal to the Transformer, relative position embeddings are used. This is in contrast to the original Transformer, which used a sinusoidal position signal or learned position embeddings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Independent \"Heads\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "The attention mechanisms in the Transformer are split up into independent \"heads\" whose outputs are concatenated before being further processed. This allows the model to process different subspaces at different positions, making the attention mechanism more effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Visualization of Self-Attention**\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiments have shown that the attention of multiple heads can be interpreted as each head processing a different subspace at a different position. Visualization of the self-attention of multiple heads reveals that each head processes syntax and semantic structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the attention mechanism in transformers is a powerful tool that enables the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the output, making it a key component of the Transformer architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Question 2] How do GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) work?\n",
      "Based on the provided context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of machine learning model that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator network takes a random noise vector as input and produces a synthetic data sample, such as an image, that is similar to the real data. The discriminator network, on the other hand, takes a data sample as input and outputs a probability that the sample is real or fake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two networks are trained simultaneously, with the generator trying to produce data samples that are indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator trying to correctly classify the samples as real or fake. This process is repeated multiple times, with the generator and discriminator updating their parameters based on the loss function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key idea behind GANs is that the generator and discriminator are in a game-like situation, where the generator tries to outsmart the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to outsmart the generator. This competition drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic data samples, and the discriminator to become increasingly accurate in its classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of image generation, the generator network can be thought of as a feature extractor, which learns to represent images in a way that is useful for generating new images. The discriminator network can be thought of as a critic, which evaluates the quality of the generated images and provides feedback to the generator.\n",
      "\n",
      "GANs have been known to be unstable to train, often resulting in generators that produce nonsensical outputs. However, the authors of the paper propose a set of constraints on the architectural topology of Convolutional GANs that make them stable to train in most settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, GANs are a powerful tool for generating realistic data samples, and have been used in a variety of applications, including image and video generation, data augmentation, and adversarial attack detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Question 3] What's the difference between RNN and LSTM?\n",
      "Based on the provided context, the main difference between Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.\n",
      "\n",
      "RNNs are widely used for processing sequential data, such as text, speech, and video. However, they have a limitation in capturing long-term dependencies due to the gradient vanishing and explosion issue. This issue occurs when the gradients of the loss function become very small or very large, causing the model to forget or overfit the input sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "LSTM, on the other hand, is a variation of RNNs designed to better capture long-term dependencies. It achieves this by introducing a memory cell that remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and three gates (input gate, output gate, and forget gate) that regulate the flow of information in and out of the cell. This allows LSTMs to effectively model tracking long-distance information/dependencies in a sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key differences between RNNs and LSTMs are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long-term dependencies**: LSTMs can capture long-term dependencies, while RNNs struggle with this due to the gradient vanishing and explosion issue.\n",
      "2. **Memory cell**: LSTMs have a memory cell that remembers values over arbitrary time intervals, while RNNs do not have this feature.\n",
      "3. **Gates**: LSTMs have three gates (input gate, output gate, and forget gate) that regulate the flow of information in and out of the cell, while RNNs do not have these gates.\n",
